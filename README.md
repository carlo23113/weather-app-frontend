The reason why my UI/UX and code implementation is the best because it's easy to navigate and can easily locate the important aspects of the application. It will not give the users a difficult time to identify what are the components for. The color scheme is balance, it's not too colorful and it's not to plain. Even though there's still some areas of improvements since I don't have much available time to develop this application since I'm still working on my current job. But, this may be not the perfect UI/UX, my heart and passion is dedicated when I'm developing this application. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to build this kind of web application.
